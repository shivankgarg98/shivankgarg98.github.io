### About Me

Hey, I’m Shivank Garg, a Sr Software System Designer at AMD, where I spend my days tinkering with the Linux kernel. I love diving into open-source projects, squashing kernel bugs, and making systems run faster and smoother. I graduated from IIT Kanpur with a dual B.Tech and M.Tech in Electrical Engineering, plus a minor in Computer Systems, which sparked my obsession with low-level programming.

My career has taken me through exciting roles, like building audio features for Android at Qualcomm, digging into cutting-edge memory systems at Intel Labs and contributing to FreeBSD through Google Summer of Code, where I built MAC policy for VNET Jails and NFS security features. I enjoy solving tough technical problems.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me lost in ghazals, rocking out to classic Bollywood tunes, or jamming to Pink Floyd, The Beatles, Poets of the Fall, Porcupine Tree, and Led Zeppelin.
